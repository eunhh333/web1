  "html5 speicification">Here comes a wave Meant</a> to wash me away A tide that is <strong>taking me <u>under</u> swallowing</strong> sand left with nothing to say My voice drowned out in the thunder. But I won't cry
And I won't start to crumble
Whenever they try
To shut me or cut me down</p>
<img src="tree.jpg" width="100%">
<p style="margin-top:40px;">I won't be silenced
You can't keep me quiet
Won't tremble when you try it
All I know is I won't go speechless
Cause I'll breathe
When they try to suffocate me
Don't you underestimate me
Cause I know that I won't go speechless
Written in stone
Every rule, every word
Centuries old and unbending
Stay in your place
Better seen and not heard
But now that story is ending</p>
